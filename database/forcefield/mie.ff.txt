; SAFT-VR Mie describes molecules as linear chain of tangentially bonded beads

; to be adjusted to specific Mie potential parameters:
;  bond length
;  bead mass

; post processing of *itp file:
; delete angle/dihedral sections if not wanted
; adjust nrexl to 1 (when no angles/dihedrals are used) 

; minimum length of monomers is 3 beads as next monomer position has to be defined by angle+ dihedral
; combining 3bead and 4bead monomers, any chain length from 6 beads can be generated

 ; comb-rule=1 allows using a general lam_r-lam_a tabulated file and providing 4*esp*sig^lam in the sigma/epsilon columns above (only possible when interactions share same Mie exponents)
