===== how to set up interactions that different monomers are compatible: ===========

rules to makes interactions with neighbours as transferable as possible (monomer chain of different types still account for all interactions properly):
 - apply interactions symmetrically when possible (angles)
 - when directional choice has to be made: pick forward direction "+"-direction (bond, dihedral)
 - all side chain interactions/ special monomer interactions have to be accounted for by monomer itself, should not rely on same monomer type as neighbours (dihedrals)


===== how to change direction of monomer (head/tail) ================================

--------------------*pdb file
swap AA and ZZ names

-------------------[mapping]
swap AA and ZZ names

-------------------[bonds]
swap AA and ZZ names
but leave  "  ZZ   +AA   " unchanged

-------------------[angles]
swap AA and ZZ names
" swap + and - "

-------------------[dihedrals]
swap AA and ZZ names
" swap + and - "
" swap + with "no+" in forward looking dihedral"

-------------------[nterminal], [cterminal]
unchanged
